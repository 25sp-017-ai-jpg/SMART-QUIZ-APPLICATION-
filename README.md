### Abstract
The Smart Quiz Application is a comprehensive web-based platform developed 
using Spring Boot framework that provides an interactive environment for 
conducting online quizzes. The system enables users to take timed quizzes on 
various topics, receive instant feedback, and review their performance with 
detailed explanations. The application features a responsive frontend built with 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that communicates with a robust backend powered 
by Spring Boot and H2 database. Key functionalities include quiz management, 
automatic scoring, time tracking, result analysis, and question review. The 
system follows MVC architecture and implements RESTful APIs for seamless 
communication between frontend and backend components. This project 
demonstrates the practical application of modern web development 
technologies in creating an educational tool that enhances learning through 
interactive assessment. 

## Introduction: 

2.1 Project Overview 
In the digital era of education, online assessment systems have become 
essential tools for evaluating knowledge and skills. The Smart Quiz Application 
is designed to address the growing need for interactive, reliable, and user
friendly online testing platforms. This system allows administrators to create 
and manage quizzes while providing users with an engaging testing experience. 

2.2 Need for the System: 
Traditional paper-based quizzes suffer from limitations such as manual grading, 
delayed results, and lack of interactive feedback. Educational institutions and 
corporate training programs require automated systems that can: 
• Provide instant evaluation and results 
• Offer detailed feedback and explanations 
• Track user progress over time 
• Support various question types 
• Ensure fair timing and monitoring 

2.3 Scope of the Project 
The Smart Quiz Application covers the following scope: 
• User registration and authentication (basic implementation) 
• Quiz creation and management 
• Multiple-choice question support 
• Real-time timer and progress tracking 
• Automatic scoring and result generation 
• Detailed performance analysis 
• Responsive web interface
